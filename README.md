# Encrypt-Decrypt
JavaFX, Java, AWS, AES and DES algorithm

The university project entails using JavaFX for constructing the user interface, Java for encryption and decryption functionalities, and hosting the database on AWS. The system implements modern encryption algorithms like DES and AES, enabling users to encrypt plaintext and decrypt ciphertext. Users can select their preferred algorithm. Additionally, the system offers the option to save/load encryption keys from a file. It incorporates secure storage and a login mechanism to ensure user security.
